# Memory Flip Game
Memory Flip Game is a simple yet challenging card-matching game built using C# for a school project. The goal is to flip two cards at a time and find all matching pairs. If the flipped cards don’t match, they automatically turn face down again.

The game includes:
- Multiple difficulty levels — higher difficulties increase the number of cards to match.
- Timer system — test your memory and speed.
- User-friendly interface — designed for an enjoyable and responsive gameplay experience.

Built entirely in C#, this project demonstrates basic programming concepts such as logic handling, randomization, timers, and event-driven design.

# Features
- Card flipping and matching mechanics
- Automatic card reset for mismatched pairs
- Increasing difficulty with more cards
- Built-in timer
- Visual feedback for matched pairs

# Technologies Used
- Language: C#
- IDE: Visual Studio
- Framework: .NET (Windows Forms or WPF depending on your build)
